# Cancer_patient_symptom_app
Renamed Vita


Experimental branch,

Purpose of this branch is to include experimental portions of the application 
into the app itself. 

Currently, it contains the following features.

1) Simple offline Messaging (can be updated to firebase, tutorial is in a comment)
2) Basic Profile page (Need to update to match design team)
3) Medication submission form
4) Camera Image Capabilities (have tensorflow lite figured out, but will not add for now)

TODOS:
1) Talk to design team to get app design as close to original sketches (this was a rough outline in order to get familiar with Dart and flutter infrastructure)

2) Incorporate the survey to get more adept feedback from the patient
3) Possible machine learning capabilities (not a must, but a probably)
4) Incorporate sensors (Vikram, You're up for this)
5) Better data analytics
